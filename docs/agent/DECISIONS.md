# Decisions

## ADR-001 — Analyst labels are trusted identity in Solo mode

Unsigned/unverified JWTs are common in lab HAR. Spec allows analyst-declared actor mapping as a trusted identity source. Default policy therefore treats `aLabel`/`bLabel` as trusted owner names when matching response `ownerId`/`userId`. Unverified JWT `sub` is never trusted.

## ADR-002 — Request body is never ownership proof

`ownerLinks` on `requestBody` (and query/path) cannot populate `ownedObjects`. Only response JSON owner fields (allowlisted) and inventory arrays on identity/private routes.

## ADR-003 — JWT subject values are never object ids

Inventory and owner-object ids that equal any captured JWT subject (even unverified) are skipped so `sub`/`userId` colliding with `/resource/{id}` cannot confirm BOLA.
